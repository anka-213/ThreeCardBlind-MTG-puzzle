# Hangarback Walker Three Card Blind Puzzle

This is an attempt at solving the Magic The Gathering Three Card Blind puzzle from this youtube video using Agda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdaiKwKN50U

The formalization of the puzzle itself is almost complete, but the proof is far from complete. Agda2hs is used to convert the formalized puzzle into a simulation for brute-forcing (using dynamic programming) in Haskell.
